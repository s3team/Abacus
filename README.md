## Introduction

Abacus is an address-based side-channel vulnerabilities detection tool. Different from previous tools, it can also 
give an estimation of the amount of the leaked information for each leakage site.

## Getting Started

### Build Instructions
**Supported OS**: Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04

**Prerequisites**: 
-  cmake 3.12 or newer
-  pkg-config
-  gcc-7

**Docker Build (Recommended)**:
~~~~{.sh}
$ git clone https://github.com/s3team/Abacus.git
$ cd Abacus
$ ./docker.sh
~~~~

After you build the docker image and enter the container, run the
following command to build Abacus.
~~~~{.sh}
$ ./build.sh
~~~~

## A Hello World Example
***Ensure from here on that you are in the Docker Container***

In the hello word example, we will guide you through the main steps needed to test a simple function
with Abacus.


```C
void is_odd(uint32_t secret) {
  int res = secret % 2;        
  if (res) {             
    printf("Odd Number\n");   // Branch 1
  } else {
    printf("Even Number\n");  // Branch 2
  }
}
```
It is a simple function. It takes a 32 bit integer as the secret input and check the last digit
of the integer. As an attacker, he can know the last digit bit of the input integer by observing
which branch is actually executed. So in the above function, we think the code has one 
secret-dependent control-flow vulnerability and it can leak one bit of information. 

The source code of the example is located at `examples\example1.c`.

#### Marking secret data as symbolic
In order to test this function with Abacus, we need to tell Abacus which variable is the secret
data. We use the function `abacus_make_symbolic`. The function takes three arguments: the type of
the symbol, the address of the secret, and the length of the secret input. In the below example,
the secret input is the variable `secret`, and its length is two bytes.

```C
int main() {
  uint16_t secret = 6;
  // uint8_t secret = 8;
  char *type = "1";
  abacus_make_symbolic(type, &secret, 2);   // The length of the key is two bytes
  is_odd(secret);
  return 0;
}
```

#### Build the example
Abacus works directly on the machine instruction. Here we build it into a 32-bit ELF executable.
Note while Abacus can work on stripped binaries without the source code. However, in the example, 
We use debug information to get a more clear result.

~~~~{.sh}
$ cd examples
$ gcc -m32 -g example1.c
~~~~

#### Collect the trace
We use the pin tool to collect the execution trace. The tool can automatically collect the trace and other
necessary runtime information.
~~~~{.sh}
$ pin -t Pintools/obj-ia32/MyPinToolLinux.so -- ./examples/a.out 
~~~~
You will get two files `Function.txt` and `Inst_data.txt`, which are the inputs of Abacus.

#### Quantify the leakage 
To run Abacus on the execution trace and get the analysis result.
~~~~{.sh}
$ ./build/App/QIF/QIF ./Inst_data.txt -f Function.txt -d ./examples/a.out  -o result.txt
~~~~

You should see the following output:
```
Start Computing Constraints
Total Constraints: 1
Control Transfer: 1
Data Access: 0
Information Leak for each address:
Address: 5664259b Leaked:1.0 bits Type: CF  Num of Satisfied: 2541 Total Sampling Numbers: 5000
Source code: ./examples/a.out: /data/shoujiki/examples/example1.c line number: 13

1.0
Time taken by SE: 0.8 seconds
Time taken by QIF: 0.8 seconds
```
As expected, it shows that the function `is_odd` has one secret-dependent control-flows at line `13`.
Also, Abacus show the vulnerability leaks 1 bit information.
